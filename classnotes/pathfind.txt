	- Pathfinding
	- Search
		- Blind Search
		- Depth First Search
			- Tries to go down one path as far as possible before
			  return
		- Linear Search
		- Search w/ Backtracking
		- State Space Search
			- State: state of the program's world
			- The code transitions the program to different states
			  to find the path from starting to end state
			- Nodes: the states & Edges: The transitions
		
	- Cons:
		- Branching Factor: Branching program causing a exponential program
		

- Heuristic Search
	- Follows a guideline instead of blind search
