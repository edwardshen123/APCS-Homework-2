Big O Notation
--------------

a function f(x) is said to be O(g(x))
--> order g(x) or Big O g(x)
if there exists some constant k, such that
kg(x) > f(x) over the long term

ex:
runtime: 2n^2 ~ O(n^2)

best-worst runtime
O(k)
O(log(n))
O(n)
O(nlog(n))
O(n^2)
O(n^3)
O(n^4)
O(2^n)
O(n!)

ex: runtime: n^2 + 30 nlog(n) --> O(n^2)

fastest runtime: constant
next: log(n)

2^n: tower problem
n!: blind search

k - eqn
log(n) - Dividing sample size
n - simple loop
nlog(n)
n^2 - loop in loop
n^3
n^4
2^n - try all possibilities
n!

graphs - collection of nodes and edges
vertex node - holds stuff
edge - connects nodes
connected component - nodes hold together by edges

cyclic
B-C

A-D

acyclic

Graphs can have weights - edges will have values (weight)
Directed Graph - Directed acyclic graph

Tree - restricts a graph
Tree: empty or acyclic graph with one node designated as the root
	Root - starting point
	Child - connected to end 1 level down from its parent node

	nodes can be both child and parent types, only root is only parent node
	root
	 O
        /|\
       O O O
      child nodes

	leaf - a node w/out children
	path - the sequence of nodes and 
	ancestors
	descendents
	subtrees
	siblings - children of same parent
	height - height of the tree
	fullness
	balance

Binary Tree: each node has 0, 1, or 2 children

Doubly Linked List

Binary Search Tree: 
	A binary tree when given the value v in any node n, 
	all the values in n's left subtree is less than v 
	and all the values in n's right subtree are greater

	to search for a value (two ways)
	- can search as binary
	- search as recursion

	ex:
	while (T != null) {
		int c = T.getData().compareTo(i);
		if (c==0) return T;
		else if (c>0) T = T.getRight();
		else T = T.getLeft(); 
	}
	return null;

	Building binary search tree:
		insert -
			Node n = new Node(data)
			if (T == null) T = n;

	problem: there are many locations to place a node
	solution: run search algorithm to node 
	and place the node in that location
	with a following pointer to place the node in that location

			1) set T = root
			2) search for n but use a following pointer T2 to follow T
			3) T2 now points to new node parent
			4) Insert the new node to the left or right of T2 as appropriate


Tree Recursion:
	Maze, Binary Sort
List within a list - tree
