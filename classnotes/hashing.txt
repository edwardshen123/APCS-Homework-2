hashing/hash table

Purpose: store data in a table (array) by some unique ID

A Hash Function is a mapping that takes an id and converts it into a table index
ex: id = OSIS#; h(x) = x%1000

Issue: when multiple IDs hash to the same table index -> collision or clash
Solution: 
hash table must be large enough so its sparsely populated
try to have a good hash function to distribute IDs all over the array

Dictionary: example of hash table
