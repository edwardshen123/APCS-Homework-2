Dijkstra's Algorithm

A* Star with weighted path

- Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm

Initial: @ Start node in solution set
Implementation:
	- Use a heap to store weight, from A to every node
Algorithm:
	1) Grab node with lowest cost/weight and add to solution set
	2) For each node in heap
		cost = min(Old cost, 
			cost to get to new node in SS 
			+ cost from new node in SS to this node)
